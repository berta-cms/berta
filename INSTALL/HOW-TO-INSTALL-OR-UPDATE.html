<h2>BERTA</h2>

	BERTA is a free content management system (CMS) created for anybody who wants
	to show their work online. BERTA is perfectly suited for portfolios of visual
	content (images and videos). 
	
	The public part of BERTA works in all major browsers and does not require flash.
	
	The private part, where the content editing takes place, should be used with
	Safari 3+ or Mozilla Firefox 3+, as it hasn't been tested in other browsers.
	A flash player 9+ is necessary for advanced file uploading features.
	
	Server requirements:
		PHP 5 with GD (for image resizing) and multibyte (unicode strings) support
		Preferably Apache webserver, but any other will do
		
	BERTA does NOT require a database. All data are stored in files on the server.

    

<h2>HOW TO INSTALL BERTA ON YOUR SERVER?</h2>

    1) In the downloaded and unzipped Berta files go to the folder <em>engine/config</em> and
       open the file inc.conf.php in a simple text editor (TextEdit on Macs or Notepad on PC).
       In place of <strong><em>admin</em></strong> and <strong><em>xxx</em></strong> write a username and password of your choice. With those you
       will log on to your Berta's engine.

    2) Copy all unzipped files to your webserver using an FTP program.
       For Macs we recommend the free <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/">CyberDuck</a>.
       For PC users we recommend the free and lightweight <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>.

       On some servers when you connect you have to navigate to the right folder
       which contains files visible from the internet. It can be called
       <em>httpdocs</em> or <em>wwwroot</em> or <em>www</em>. Ask your hosting provider if you're unsure.

    3) When the files are on the server, in the same folder where you put the other files
       create a folder named (all lower case letters):
	
            <strong><em>storage</em></strong> 
			
       and set it writable:
	
            In CyberDuck click on <em>storage</em> folder and press Command-I on your
            keyboard. Tick all checkboxes in the permissions sections and press <em>Apply</em>.
            In FileZilla right-click on <em>storage</em> folder and choose <em>File
            Permissions</em>. Then tick all checkboxes and press <em>OK</em>.
			
    4) Open your browser (for editing please use only Safari or Firefox), and navigate to
	
            www.yourdomain.com/engine/
		
	   where www.yourdomain.com is the address of your site. Then log in using the username
	   and password you set earlier in step (1) and follow the final install instructions on the screen.



<h2>HOW TO UPDATE FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION?</h2>

	The procedure is the same as installing new version except the step (3) as the storage
	folder is a place where all your content lives. In case you have installed custom templates, 
	you will also need to keep the templates folder. But otherwise everything else
	should be overwritten.
	
	PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU UPDATE FROM 0.4b OR OLDER VERSION TO ANYTHING ABOVE 0.5b, THEN
	SOME OF YOUR DATE MIGHT BE LOST!!!!
